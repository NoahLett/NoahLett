  ### :speech_balloon: About Me
------

  I'm Noah, a software developer with a love for learning new things, setting tangible goals, and creating programs with the languages I know, such as JavaScript, React, Node.js, CSS, HTML5, and more. My journey to becoming a software developer is somewhat of a unique one, but I'm proud to say I absolutely love what I do.
